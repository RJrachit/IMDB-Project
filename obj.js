Something that our youth and parents need to understand that failure is not the ending of the world and stop pressuring their kids and supporting them to atleast give their best and need not to worry about failure. Life has crores of things in which one can be good at. So give your best embrace the results and move on. Life has so much for you ahead. Without a second thought go with your complete family to watch it.',

      reviewText: "This is not a film where the friends characters are just in the backgeound laughing for hero's jokes and just shedding few tears in emotional scenes, they play a very important role and carey the film on their shoulders! The performances are just mind blowing, after so long Shraddha kapoor has got a chance to show what she is. Sushanth is wonderful in his role, and the film also touches few social topics and leaves you with a message. The dialogues and college episodes are just mindblowing and it brings you laughs. You laugh so much that you no more care about the world. The director runs the screenplay of the past and the present simultaneously which is really fresh on the film. The sports episodes are also picturised in a clean way instead of adding a cinematic feel into it. Bottomline- you can watch it a million times and will never be bored.",

Despite the weakness of the film, I love this Nitesh Tiwari directional. it's full of hilarious moments made us (audience) laught out loud. We will be invited to reminisce into college days like 3 Idiots with different atmosphere and themes, but with almost the same impact. I know, the transition of flashback scene was not seamless. Sometimes, it seemed out of control. But believe me, it'll be still on the right track till the end. The performances of lead cast was also just okay, not that great. It was the supporting cast who looked stunning in this film. But overall, the chemistry between casts was excellent. Go for this one! You will regret if you missed watching this film at nearby cinema! Unfortunately, this one is limited in my country, Indonesia.",

      reviewText: 'Chhichhore - Indian films have now come of age, they can give a message subtly without being preachy. Chhichhore begins with young Raghav suffering from a massive anxiety about whether he will crack the all India engineering entrance exam as he has invested 18 hours a day for the past many months preparing for it and wants to match the caliber of his parents.\n' +
        '\n' +
        "A failure to launch throws him into despair and the occasion brings together six middle aged people into a reunion with the objective of alleviating Raghav from his pain and encouraging him to bring hope back into his fragile life. LOSERS, as these six were known as in their student life, recount their carefree journey initially and the final effort to shrug off the underdog tag, drawing a significant parallel to Raghav's situation.\n" +
        '\n' +
        'Director Nitesh Tiwari handles the subject with sensitivity and balances the Losers journey through the undergraduate years well. There was ample temptation available to propel this segment of the film into being an over the top and loud essay, but Tiwari never gives in, thus rising above the ordinary. Sushant Singh Rajput delivers an underrated performance and Tahir Raj Bhasin adds gravitas. Naveen Polishetty, Tushar Pandey and Saharsh Kumar Shukla add to the little masala with their individual contribution, but the star of the Losers union must be Varun Sharma. He is absolutely a laugh riot with his expressions, one liners and an incredible energy, cracking up the theatre on numerous occasions. The weakest link is yet again Shraddha Kapoor, who needs to experiment with diversity of histrionic capabilities and expressions.\n' +

        'A film of impeccable pedigree, a breezy entertainer with its heart in the right place! Director Nitesh Tiwari is truly working at the height of his creative powers. Sterling!\n' +
        '\n' +
        "You expect the moon from this Fox Star Studios and Nadiadwala Grandson Entertainment's production as far as the entertainment goes because it's Nitesh Tiwari's next release after Dangal. Let me make it clear right away. There are films & there are more films and then there's Chhichhore. It can be rightly termed as a slice of life film. Nitesh Tiwari understands the intricacies of human behaviour & strives to deftly integrate authentic characters & bona fide situations on celluloid. Technically too, the product is first-rate.\n" +
        '\n' +
        'The initial reels are full of light moments & keep the viewer in splits with witty one-liners. More than the story, it is the screenplay (Nitesh Tiwari, Piyush Gupta & Nikhil Mehrotra) that should be talked about. You will be high on nostalgia for sure!ï¿½ï¿½\n' +
        '\n' +
        "One more thing! You cannot draw parallels with any other film, past or present, successful or unsuccessful. If masala means entertainment, amusement, hilarity, escapade, emotions and drama, yes, Chhichhore has it all. Only thing, it's treated differently!\n" +
        '\n' +
        "Every person behind the camera gives his/her best to the film. Amalendu Chaudhary's exquisite cinematography is another aspect that catches your attention. The feel of the film has been cut, compiled & presented with dexterity by editor Charu Shree Roy. Nimble-fingered!\n" +
        '\n' +
        "Pritam's music perfectly grows on you after you've watched the film. Sameer Uddin's background score uplifts the overall mood. Amitabh Bhattacharya's lyrics leave an impression. And the best is reserved for the last - Mukesh Chhabra's casting is spot on!\n" +
        '\n' +
        "Chhichhore boasts of an exuberant on-screen ensemble cast. As a matter of fact, it's an unusual mix of actors & they unequivocally shine collectively. Together, as a group of friends, they have an easy camaraderie that's easily relatable. Sushant Singh Rajput is blessed with wonderful screen presence & gets the timing of his character right. Watch out for him in the scene where he goes tongue-tied in front of Maya. Shraddha Kapoor emotes with utmost conviction, proving her mettle as an actress of substance. Varun Sharma is superb in his comic timing. His appearance, mannerisms & dialogue delivery are exemplary. Tahir Raj Bhasin portrays the role with plentiful charm & magnetism. Naveen Polishetty is quite a scene-stealer on more occasions than one. Excellent!\n" +
        '\n' +
        "Prateik Babbar's registers a strong impact despite the small role. Tushar Pandey plays to the gallery & delivers a sparkling performance. Saharsh Kumar is in terrific form & portrays his role with precision. Chhichhore belongs to everyone. Copybook!\n" +
        '\n' +
        'On the whole, Chhichhore is brimming with solid content with a relevant message. Watch it for the spirit it is made in. Sometimes, we laugh at movies. At times, we laugh in movies. Chhichhore belongs to the latter type. Get ready to relive your college life!',

      reviewText: "The movie has a very good plot. Direction is great. Dialogues are great too. All the main actors have done really well. Varun, Naveen, Tushar, Tahir along with Sushant and Sushant have really filled the movie with lots of humour. There were tense moments involving human actions and emotions. I loved the way parallelism has worked in the movie. What I didn't like about the movie were some impractical elements and poor acting by some characters. Nonetheless the movie is a great and must watch. If you have lived in a hostel or you have spent a lot of great times with your friends, you can find moments to relate yourself. The movie also teaches us about our expectations from life and from those who are around us, especially the kids. It keeps us entertained and engaged throughout the runtime. Definitely one of the best movies of the decade. Go watch it..",

      reviewText: "IIT Bombay is Alma mater of director Nitesh Tiwari. I don't think anyone else could have done the justice with this film. He has blended his experience in IIT with the typical problem of dealing with failure and ensured that the audience leave theatre with euphoric feeling at the end. He has captured the essence of college life and mixed with a impactful message for young guns. Something a very few directors are capable of pulling this off. This film brings back the memories of IIT. Though it was KGP for me. It's a must watch film.",
