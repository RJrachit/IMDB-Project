Breaking Bad may not depict reality the way 'Generation Kill' or 'The Wire' did - but then it's not about that, either. From an artistic point of view - performances, writing, direction, camera, music - this show is every bit as good as the other two mentioned above, but unlike those, 'Breaking Bad' just wants to entertain and therefore enjoys a lot more creative freedom.\n\nThe show plays like the daydream fantasy of any underachieving, struggling middle class family man who's had to bury all his dreams (I mean: who wouldn't want to be a meth-kingpin for a little while?), before it turns into a nightmare. One could almost say that 'Heisenberg' is Walter White's 'Tyler Durden'(for those who don't get the reference: watch 'Fight Club' - you won't regret it).\n\nFor pure entertainment value, this is simply the best show I've ever seen. Every single one of the main characters has already reached the status of a screen icon - when does that ever happen?!

Ever.\n\nWe start out with one main character, Walter White (played by Bryan Cranston), who is struggling to make ends meet working both as a high school chemistry teacher and part time at a car wash. Then he gets diagnosed with cancer. Then he breaks bad.\n\nTeaming up with an unlikely sidekick, Jesse Pinkman (played by Aaron Paul), who is the immature \"yo, bitch\"-spouting, high-school-screw-up small-time drug dealer, Walt and Jesse both put their skills towards the drug world to try to make good by their families.\n\nThis show has been masterfully put together with layer upon layer of insight into some of the most interesting characters ever realized in the history of television. We have some very dark characters, and a lot of grey characters, and it all adds up to brilliant dialogue and plot lines.\n\nThe creator, writers, directors and actors have paid attention to every single detail, putting thought into every nuance in every character in every scene. Because of this attention to detail there is something for everyone in this show. Every thinking brain will immediately be attracted to the intelligence so evidently on display, that even if you're not a drug dealing chemist living in Albuquerque, you will find something in the characters that connects you to them and makes you hang on for dear life.\n\nGet on your couch now and start watching \"Breaking Bad\" from the very beginning, and don't miss a single scene.","reviewTitle":"Breaking Bad is the best television show","spoiler":true,"submissionDate":"2010-05-17","titleId":"/title/tt0903747/"},{"author":{"displayName":"valis1949","userId":"/user/ur3173363/"},"authorRating":10,"helpfulnessScore":0.7603361103548986,"id":"/title/tt0903747/userreviews/rw2029161","interestingVotes":{"down":208,"up":769},"languageCode":"eng","reviewText":"BREAKING BAD:Season One explodes like a sucker punch to the gut, and is nothing short of mind-blowing.

However, through a marvelous piece of editing and writing, the plot miraculously moves forward from that point. Bryon Cranston's idiosyncratic performance is a joy to behold. He embodies a man who is against a rock, and an even harder place, who has no other option but to throttle his higher aspirations and grimly carry on. His solace and validation in middle-class morality and virtuous conduct is long gone.

This is the best television series I've ever seen, and really goes into the realm of feature films as well, as far as being in my top ten. I cannot think of anything as of late that punched me in the face like this show did. I absolutely love it. If you have not seen it, do yourself a HUGE favor and rent the first season so you'll know what's going on, and you can see the transition of the characters.

Definitely not for everyone but finally something that feels real.\n\nI personally like the fact they pull no punches. I find myself pausing at the fact that I am so intrigued by this hard core street wise program, more than any of the other big name series. This one really hits home and gives a true behind the scenes look at what most would consider the bad guys. I'm not condoning the contents of the story, and I don't think the show is either, there is no glamor in what these boys are doing, but it's giving an insight to the darker side of many streets. \n\nHow the denial and desperation that can occur to the common working stand up citizen, the pillar of society that suddenly changes his moral standing in a society driven by the almighty dollar. This is pretty dam close to Fallen (Michel Douglas) but with up to date street smarts nd a lot more punch. \n\nThe characters don't over exaggerate their roles and the story line isn't filled with cleaver dialog or near to impossible feats of bravery or beating impossible odds. Just true to life screwed up events that could take place in the real world. I think they did their research on this one. Good work everyone. \n\nI hope we get more than a second and third season out of this great crew (every one of them). From the writing and production sets to the acting, costumes, lighting, filming and originality. I've seen a few good series lost to the wrong decision makers, hope this one doesn't end up short (long live FireFly)\n\nChuckbytes","reviewTitle":"Please stay on the air....","spoiler":false,"submissionDate":"2008-10-31","titleId":"/title/tt0903747/"},{"author":{"displayName":"johnandpheebs","userId":"/user/ur7141244/"},"authorRating":10,"helpfulnessScore":0.7383408915932819,"id":"/title/tt0903747/userreviews/rw4891659","interestingVotes":{"down":36,"up":146},"languageCode":"eng","reviewText":"Many years ago, a friend of mine told me to watch this new series called Breaking Bad. The way he raved about it I thought I'd give it a go just to shut him up. I really couldn't get in to it and, after the pilot episode, gave up and didn't watch it any more. Fast forward to 2019.

Now, I don't know if I've changed in these past years or I just didn't give it long enough first time round but, Wow! Over the last three weeks I have binge watched the entire series, averaging four episodes a day (unfortunately I have to work as well). What can I say about this series that hasn't already been said by other reviewers who are more grammatically articulate than I am. It easy to see why Breaking Bad won as many awards as it did. The writing is superb, not to mention the acting from its two main stars, Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul as Walt and Jesse. By the end of the last episode I felt my heart was broken. Like a break up in a relationship I would now have to get by without these two in my life. It's been an emotional rollercoaster of a ride but I enjoyed every minute of it. From Jesse's awkward moment having dinner with Walt and Sky, to Walt's maniacal laughter whilst under the floorboards of his house. So to my friend I owe an apology.

This is somehow realistic and amazing also. I have watched so many \"Based On A True Story\" movies but none of them real amazing for me. (Just A Beautiful Mind was very good.)\n\nI don't know how script writers think this serie. It is real complicated and amazing story. I did watch this serie twice. I tried to find nonsense parts. I just found two nonsense things in all five seasons. It is best crime, drama TV series possible. Amazing storyline, acting, cinematography. Definetly it is the best tv serie of all time.","reviewTitle":"Truly Amazing, Wonderful, Perfect.","spoiler":false,"submissionDate":"2019-06-17","titleId":"/title/tt0903747/"}],"comments":[{"upvotes":{"users":["adasdasdasd","popa"],"sum":2},"_id":"5f0ac387c351540670afb303","titleId":"tt0903747","username":"rj_rachit","firstName":"Rachit","lastName":"J","date":"Jul 12","body":"rr","__v":8},{"upvotes":{"users":["popa"],"sum":1},"_id":"5f0ac96ec351540670afb30b","titleId":"tt0903747","username":"popa","firstName":"rrrr","lastName":"","date":"Jul 12","body":"hhhh","__v":1},{"upvotes":{"users":[],"sum":0},"_id":"5f0acfc832f12f22e873e425","titleId":"tt0903747","username":"popa","firstName":"rrrr","lastName":"","date":"Jul 12","body":"","__v":0}],"auth":false,"user":{},"username":""}
